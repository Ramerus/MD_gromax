# GROMAX lib
## This library allows you:
* download information about your system
* calculate contact angles with accuracy 2.5 degrees
* calculate density profile for systems with minerals and without
  
## To use the library for your experiments you need:
* trappe.top file of your system
* molecular.xlsx - file, with describtion of atom names(in .gro and in trappe.top)
* trappe.xlsx with masses of your atoms

## The algorithms:
* DBSCAN-based clustering
* Density profile
* Contact angle
